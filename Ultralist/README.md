### Only for the insane
What?! How dare I say that. Oh right, that's for the blocking maniac like you. Don't get me wrong, I get it, blocking ads is the go-to for improving your online activity and block all trackers. You and I, we're the same, but let's face it, we both know this list will become far too large. 

### ⚠️ APPROACH WITH CARE ⚠️
It is imparative that you understand that this list may not at all work. It's only for the adrenaline rushers that want to experience something. We don't know what, but for those of you who hope this works, well... Good luck!

### Credits
Since we're not only using our own filters, I do want to list all curators of who we use the lists in order to compile it to what this has become. Since we want to be transparent about all of this, we want everyone to be credited who's curated lists that are compiled here, except for ourselves.

### ⚠️ WARNING ⚠️
This list is incredibly big. Be wary that this list WILL break elements during browsing. Use at your own accord. We are NOT updating this list ourselves and will not look for fixes specific to this block list, only our other lists.
