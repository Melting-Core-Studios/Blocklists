# Blocklists
Lists of URLs that can be blocked to prevent tracking. The lists are composed using existing filtering methods, both well known and experimental. It is also attempted to include regularly used bypasses that companies, such as Google and Microsoft, often use. 

# WARNING
All current lists are in active development. See the releases for the most stable builds. If the releases are empty or removed, the lists are found to be too buggy.
