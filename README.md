# Blocklists
Lists of URLs that can be blocked to prevent tracking. The lists are composed using existing filtering methods, both well known and experimental. It is also attempted to include regularly used bypasses that companies, such as Google and Microsoft, often use. 

## ⚠️ WARNING ⚠️
All current lists are in active development. See the releases for the most stable builds. If the releases are empty or removed, the lists are found to be too buggy. 

## How are they set up
The lists are composed through the use of other blocklists we like to use in our content blockers, and the use of AI to verify that they are widely known (to prevent unneccessary blockers). The lists are all made with longevity in mind, and will adapt when needed. Through the use of Regex entries, we've attempted to enhance the lists we've curated to also "attack" adblock bypasses. The lists are created to offer maximum privacy without breaking core functionality of the services you'd use daily. 

## Combined blocklists
Nobody wants to reinvent the wheel, neither do we. That's why we provide a combined list per category (and soon a full combined list) that combines the filter lists of multiple vendors (each is credited). Through a painfully set up GitHub Workflow there is an hourly check for updates. As soon as an update is available, the list in which the update occurs will be updated accordingly. We also provide our own small additions to the most common lists using both regular blocks and regex filters to provide additional and more dynamic filter rules in an attempt to fight the bypasses, all for free. 

## Active development
The lists are under active development and testing. Releases will indicate the latest stable version of each list. They will also be uploaded to my website once a full stable release is realized after which this repository will serve as the dev build host.
