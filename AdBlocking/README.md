### Combined list, by Melting Core Studios
Hello everyone. You're currently viewing the combined list for AdBlocking. This list consists of multiple, freely available lists and will be updated regularly and automatically. This list is compiled through the Workflow of GitHub. Since reinventing the wheel would cost too much time, we've decided we'll invest our time in a regex list to dynamically target ads, rather than compose a list that already exists. Other than the regexes found in our list, we do not take credit. 

### Credits
Since this list uses freely available lists, and we want to provide full transparency, we want to list every contributer to this list of which we've automated the integration with our own research. All the credit go to these creators for their efforts in fighting for your right to privacy.

### ⚠️ WARNING ⚠️
As always with our lists, it's important to note that these lists MAY break your browsing experience. This list is merely here to provide a full, dedicated list of several blocking lists that, combined into one, will provide a much more user-friendly experience when importing this into your content blocker.
